
UAT FRAMEWORK SUCCESSFULLY RESOLVES HUBBLE TENSION:

• Hubble Constant: H0 = 73.0 km/s/Mpc (SH0ES value maintained)
• Sound Horizon: r_d = 132.3 Mpc (10.0% reduction from Planck)
• Early Universe Parameter: k_early = 0.900
• Density Change: -10.0% in early universe
• Statistical Improvement: Delta_chi2 = +214.1

PHYSICAL IMPLICATIONS:
• Consistent with Loop Quantum Gravity effects at high energies
• Modifies expansion history only in early universe (z > 300)
• Provides natural mechanism for r_d reduction
• Maintains consistency with late-time observations

CONCLUSION:
The UAT framework demonstrates that incorporating quantum gravitational
effects in the early universe provides a physically motivated solution
to the Hubble tension while maintaining excellent fit to BAO data.
