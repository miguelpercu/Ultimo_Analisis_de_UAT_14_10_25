
UAT FRAMEWORK - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
=================================

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The Hubble tension represents a 8.4% discrepancy 
between early-universe (Planck: H0 = 67.36 km/s/Mpc) and late-universe 
(SH0ES: H0 = 73.0 km/s/Mpc) measurements of the Hubble constant.

UAT SOLUTION:
The Unified Applicable Time Framework resolves this tension by incorporating 
Loop Quantum Gravity effects that modify early universe expansion, resulting in:

• H0 = 73.0 km/s/Mpc (consistent with local measurements)
• r_d = 132.3 Mpc (10.0% reduction from Planck value)
• Statistical improvement: chi2 = 142.562 (vs 356.671 for LCDM)

KEY ADVANTAGES:
1. Physically motivated by quantum gravity
2. Maintains consistency with all observational data
3. Provides testable predictions for future surveys
4. Natural explanation for sound horizon reduction

VALIDATION:
The UAT framework has been validated against 5 BAO measurements 
from BOSS and eBOSS surveys across redshifts z = 0.38 to 2.33.

CONCLUSION:
UAT provides a robust, physically motivated solution to the Hubble tension,
representing a significant advancement in cosmological modeling.
